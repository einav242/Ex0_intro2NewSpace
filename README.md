# Ex0_intro2NewSpace


This project is a simulation of the guidance and landing of a spacecraft on the moon. 
The main objective is to develop an optimal control system that will enable a safe landing of the spacecraft 
while maximizing the fuel left after landing.
We will use Java programming language to implement this simulation. 
We will first model the physical environment of the moon's gravity and create a mathematical model for the spacecraft's motion. 
We will then develop a control system that will use this mathematical model to determine the optimal thrust 
required for the engines to land the spacecraft safely

#### Steps to Run the Simulation:
Clone this repository to your local machine.<br />
Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.<br />
run Bereshit_101.java.<br />
The simulation will print at each stage the data on the spacecraft, such as vertical speed, horizontal speed, angle, fuel, acceleration, and more.

## Additional files:
1. Excel file containing landing results with corresponding graphs. <br /> 
2. PDF file with the first part of the task  - the reasons of the crash.<br />
